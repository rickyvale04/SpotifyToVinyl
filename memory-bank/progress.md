# Progress

This document tracks the progress of the SpotifyToVinyl project, documenting completed milestones, ongoing work, and upcoming tasks to provide a clear timeline of development.

## Project Milestones
- **Initial Setup (Completed)**:
  - **Date**: Prior to July 2025
  - **Achievements**: Project structure established with Next.js, React components, and basic routing. Core files like `package.json`, `next.config.js`, and initial UI components in `components/` created.
  - **Notes**: Foundation laid for further feature development.

- **Spotify API Integration (Partially Completed)**:
  - **Date**: Ongoing as of July 1, 2025
  - **Achievements**: Authentication flow implemented using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE in `lib/spotifyAuth.jsx` and `lib/spotifyNew.jsx`. API endpoints for Spotify interaction set up in `pages/api/spotify/`.
  - **Recent Update**: Fixed issue with `client_secret` being undefined by updating `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET` and restarting the server.
  - **Notes**: Authentication needs final testing to confirm stability.

- **UI Development (Partially Completed)**:
  - **Date**: Ongoing
  - **Achievements**: Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS. Key components like `Layout.jsx`, `Sidebar.jsx`, `VinylItem.jsx`, and search functionality (`SearchBar.jsx`) created for user interaction.
  - **Notes**: UI for vinyl saving feature still under development.

- **MongoDB Setup (In Progress)**:
  - **Date**: Started as of July 1, 2025
  - **Achievements**: Connection logic added in `lib/mongo/index.jsx`. Environment variable `MONGODB_URI` configured in `.env.local`.
  - **Notes**: Schema design for vinyl data storage in `models/vinyls.js` pending completion and testing.

- **Memory Bank Documentation (In Progress)**:
  - **Date**: Initiated on July 1, 2025
  - **Achievements**: Created `memory-bank/` folder with initial files: `projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`. Currently documenting progress in this file.
  - **Notes**: Configuration for Cline globs and workflow setup still required.

## Completed Tasks
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up `.env.local` with necessary variables for Spotify API and MongoDB connection.
- **Authentication Debugging**: Resolved token exchange error by ensuring `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET` is available to client-side code.
- **Server Restart**: Successfully restarted development server on port 3002 to apply environment changes.
- **Initial Documentation**: Completed core content for several memory bank files to establish project context.

## Ongoing Work
- **Vinyl Saving Feature**: Developing the functionality to save Spotify tracks or playlists as virtual vinyl records. Requires UI integration and backend API endpoints.
- **Database Testing**: Ensuring MongoDB connection works and can store user data effectively.
- **Memory Bank Completion**: Finalizing documentation files and setting up Cline configuration for memory tracking.
- **Workflow Creation**: Preparing to create `.cline/workflows/update-memory-bank.md` for managing Plan/Act Mode updates.

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Cline Configuration**: Add glob patterns to `.cline/config.json` to include memory bank files for tracking.
- **Workflow Implementation**: Define the update process for memory bank files in a dedicated workflow file.
- **Full Authentication Test**: Run the application to confirm Spotify login works without errors post-fix.
- **User Flow Development**: Complete the end-to-end user experience from Spotify authentication to saving a vinyl record, including UI feedback and data storage.
- **Performance Review**: Assess application load times and API response handling to identify optimization needs.

## blockers
- **Authentication Verification**: Need to confirm if Spotify token exchange now works correctly after environment variable updates. This is critical before proceeding with other API-dependent features.
- **MongoDB Schema**: Final schema design for vinyl data storage is pending, which delays full implementation of the saving feature.

## Timeline Overview
- **July 1, 2025 (Current Date)**: Focused on memory bank setup, authentication fixes, and MongoDB integration planning.
- **Short-Term (Next 1-2 Weeks)**: Complete memory bank setup, test Spotify authentication, finalize MongoDB schema, and start vinyl saving feature UI.
- **Mid-Term (Next Month)**: Implement and test vinyl saving functionality, refine UI/UX based on user feedback, and address performance optimizations.
- **Long-Term (Beyond One Month)**: Add advanced features like social sharing of vinyl collections, explore Discogs API for additional vinyl data, and prepare for production deployment.

## Progress Metrics
- **Code Completion**: Approximately 60% of core functionality implemented (based on file structure and feature presence).
- **Feature Readiness**:
  - Authentication: 90% (pending final test).
  - UI Components: 70% (core layout done, vinyl-specific UI pending).
  - Database Integration: 40% (connection set, schema and testing pending).
  - Vinyl Saving Feature: 20% (conceptual, implementation started).
- **Documentation**: 80% for memory bank setup as of current files created.

## Notes for Future Updates
- Use the `/update-memory-bank` command in Cline to refresh `activeContext.md` and this `progress.md` file after significant development sessions or milestone achievements.
- Regularly review blockers and update timelines to reflect realistic goals based on current challenges or resource availability.

This progress log will be updated as tasks are completed or new objectives are set, ensuring a clear record of the SpotifyToVinyl project's development journey.
