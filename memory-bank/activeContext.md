# Active Context

This document captures the current state of active development, ongoing tasks, and immediate priorities for the SpotifyToVinyl project. It serves as a dynamic snapshot of what is being worked on right now.

## Current Development Focus
- **Spotify Authentication Fix**: Recently resolved an issue where the `client_secret` was undefined during token exchange. Updated `.env.local` to include `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET` and restarted the development server to apply changes.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Working on setting up a connection to MongoDB to store user vinyl data for historical tracking. The connection logic is in `lib/mongo/index.jsx`.
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Currently creating the `memory-bank/` folder structure and associated files to document project context, progress, and system patterns as requested.

## Active Tasks
1. **Complete Memory Bank File Creation**:
   - Finish creating all required markdown files in `memory-bank/` (e.g., `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
   - Ensure content reflects the current state of the project accurately.
2. **Configure Cline Globs**:
   - Update or create `.cline/config.json` to include the glob pattern `["memory-bank/**/*.md"]` for memory tracking.
3. **Set Up Workflow for Plan/Act Mode**:
   - Create the workflow file `.cline/workflows/update-memory-bank.md` to define steps for updating memory bank files.
4. **Vinyl Saving Feature**:
   - Develop UI components and backend logic to allow users to save Spotify tracks or playlists as virtual vinyl records.
   - Ensure data is stored in MongoDB via API endpoints.

## Immediate Priorities
- **Finalize Memory Bank Setup**: Complete the setup of all memory bank files and configuration to ensure project documentation is in place for future reference.
- **Test Spotify Authentication**: Verify that the recent fix for token exchange works by running the application and attempting to log in with Spotify.
- **Database Connection Testing**: Confirm that MongoDB connection is stable and can store/retrieve vinyl data as expected.

## Current Challenges
- **Authentication Stability**: Ensuring the Spotify token exchange process no longer fails due to environment variable issues. Monitoring for any additional errors during user login.
- **User Data Storage**: Designing an effective schema in MongoDB for vinyl records that can handle various data structures from Spotify (tracks, playlists).

## Recent Changes
- **Environment Variable Update**: Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET` to `.env.local` to resolve token exchange errors with Spotify API.
- **Server Restart**: Restarted the development server on port 3002 to apply environment changes.
- **Memory Bank Initiation**: Started creating the `memory-bank/` folder structure with initial files like `projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps
- **Complete Remaining Memory Bank Files**: Finish writing content for `progress.md` to document project milestones and updates.
- **Implement Cline Workflow**: Create the workflow file for updating memory bank content as part of the Plan/Act Mode process.
- **MongoDB Schema Finalization**: Define and test the MongoDB schema for vinyl data storage in `models/vinyls.js`.
- **User Testing for Authentication**: Once authentication is confirmed working, test the full user flow from login to vinyl saving.

## Collaboration Notes
- **Team Communication**: If working with others, ensure all team members are aware of the memory bank setup for consistent project documentation.
- **Feedback Loop**: After completing the current setup, request user feedback on the memory bank structure and content to refine it further.

This active context will be updated regularly as development progresses, tasks are completed, or new priorities emerge. Use the `/update-memory-bank` command in Cline to trigger updates to this file and `progress.md` after significant changes.
