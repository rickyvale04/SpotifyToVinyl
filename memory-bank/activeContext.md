## Immediate Priorities
- **User Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all implemented features to ensure stability
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor API call efficiency and caching strategies
- **Documentation**: Complete project documentation with current state and features
- **Future Feature Planning**: Plan next development phase based on current stable foundation

## Current Challenges
- **API Rate Limiting**: Managing Discogs API rate limits (60 calls per minute) with proper caching
- **User Experience**: Ensuring smooth workflow from playlist selection to vinyl management
- **Authentication Persistence**: Maintaining both Spotify and Discogs authentication states
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring all features work across different browsers and devices

## Recent Changes
- **TrackListItem.jsx**: Complete integration of vinyl availability, wantlist, and details functionality
- **Song.jsx**: Fixed wantlist check to only occur on button press, not page load
- **Sidebar.jsx**: Added router.push('/') to Home button for proper navigation
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented `/api/discogs/wantlist.js` and fixed `/api/discogs/wantlist-check.js`
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in `useDiscogsWantlist.js` hook
- **Navigation**: Unified playlist navigation behavior across home page and sidebar
- **Layout**: Removed duplicate sidebar issues in playlist pages
- **Environment**: Server running on port 3002 with all environment variables configured
- **Repository**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub repository

## Next Steps
- **Feature Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all implemented functionality
- **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback on the new integrated features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor API performance and optimize caching strategies
- **Code Review**: Review and refactor code for maintainability and performance
- **Documentation**: Update README and technical documentation
- **Future Features**: Plan next development phase (e.g., collection management, advanced search)

## Technical Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS, and Recoil state management
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for Spotify, OAuth 1.0a for Discogs
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API, Discogs API with proper authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence (configured but not heavily used yet)

   - Wantlist management (add/check status)
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - API rate limiting and caching

4. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Removed playlist stats bar
   - Improved hover effects and transitions
   - Better responsive design
   - Consistent styling across components
