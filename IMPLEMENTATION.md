# Implementation Plan for SpotifyToVinyl Application

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for the SpotifyToVinyl web application, designed to bridge digital music streaming with physical vinyl collecting. The goal is to establish a robust framework that can be handed off to a developer for further implementation. The plan is broken into discrete phases to ensure a structured approach to development, focusing initially on setting up the environment, models, databases, and key routes as placeholders for full functionality.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (version 13.4.4) for server-side rendering, routing, and API endpoints.
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for managing Spotify OAuth sessions.
- **State Management**: Recoil for handling application state like playlists and user data.
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistent storage of user vinyl history.
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API for music data and Discogs API for vinyl information.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for theming and UI components.
- **Runtime**: Node.js for server-side operations.

## App Structure
- **Pages**: Next.js pages for routing, including `index.jsx` (dashboard), `login.jsx`, `callback.jsx` (auth handling), and `search/index.jsx`.
- **Components**: React components for UI, split into main sections (`Dashboard`, `Sidebar`), song management (`SongTable`, `Song`), and UI elements (`Button`, `Header`).
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions in `pages/api/` for Spotify and Discogs interactions, authentication, and data fetching.
- **State Management**: Recoil atoms for playlist and user data (`atoms/playlistAtom.jsx`, `atoms/playlistId.jsx`).
- **Libraries**: Utility functions for Spotify and Discogs API interactions (`lib/spotify.jsx`, `lib/discogs.jsx`), and MongoDB helpers (`lib/mongo/`).
- **Styles**: Global CSS with Tailwind (`styles/globals.css`).

This structure supports scalability by modularizing UI components, API interactions, and state management, allowing for easy addition of features like user-specific vinyl history or advanced search capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Dependency Verification
- **Objective**: Ensure the development environment is correctly configured and all dependencies are installed.
- **Tasks**:
  - Verify Node.js and npm versions compatibility with Next.js 13.4.4.
  - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies from `package.json` are installed.
  - Check and update `.env.local` for necessary environment variables (e.g., Spotify Client ID, MongoDB URI, NextAuth settings).
  - Test the development server with `npm run dev -- -p 3002` to confirm basic setup.
- **Deliverables**: A fully configured development environment ready for coding.

### Phase 2: Database Setup and Models
- **Objective**: Establish MongoDB connection and define data models for vinyl history.
- **Tasks**:
  - Confirm MongoDB URI in `.env.local` connects to the user's Atlas cluster.
  - Review and refine `lib/mongo/helpers.jsx` to ensure functions like `getVinyls` and `postVinyls` support user-specific data storage.
  - Define schemas or models if necessary in `models/vinyls.js` for structured data storage.
- **Deliverables**: Functional MongoDB connection with basic CRUD operations for vinyl data.

### Phase 3: Authentication Framework
- **Objective**: Set up authentication with Spotify using NextAuth.js.
- **Tasks**:
  - Verify `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].jsx` is configured for Spotify OAuth.
  - Ensure `pages/login.jsx` and `pages/callback.jsx` handle authentication flow correctly.
  - Test authentication by logging in with a Spotify account to confirm token storage and session management.
- **Deliverables**: Working authentication flow with Spotify integration.

### Phase 4: Core API Routes as Stubs
- **Objective**: Create placeholder API routes for key functionalities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Review and stub out `pages/api/spotify/` endpoints for playlist and track fetching if not fully implemented.
  - Set up `pages/api/discogsSearch.jsx` as a placeholder for vinyl search functionality with Discogs API.
  - Ensure `pages/api/albumSearch.jsx` can handle basic queries as a stub.
- **Deliverables**: Placeholder API routes for Spotify and Discogs interactions, ready for full implementation.

### Phase 5: Basic UI Framework
- **Objective**: Establish the core UI structure with placeholder components.
- **Tasks**:
  - Confirm `pages/index.jsx` renders the `Dashboard` component correctly.
  - Ensure `components/Layout.jsx` provides a consistent layout for all pages.
  - Set up `components/main/Dashboard.jsx` to display playlists as a stub, even if data fetching is not fully functional.
- **Deliverables**: Basic UI framework with placeholders for dynamic content.

### Phase 6: Debugging and Error Resolution Framework
- **Objective**: Address the current runtime error and establish a debugging process.
- **Tasks**:
  - Follow the debugging steps in `debug-vinyl-flow.md` to check authentication, playlist fetching, Discogs integration, and vinyl saving.
  - Update `docs/debug_report.md` with findings from each debugging step.
  - Isolate the "TypeError: destroy is not a function" error by commenting out components or updating dependencies as needed.
- **Deliverables**: A documented debugging process with progress towards resolving the current error.

## Next Steps After Phase Completion
- Each phase will be tested for functionality before moving to the next.
- Progress will be documented in a `PROGRESS.md` file after each phase, outlining completed tasks, issues encountered, and next steps.
- Subsequent phases will focus on full implementation of features like user-specific vinyl history, advanced search, and UI enhancements.

This plan provides a structured approach to setting up the foundational framework for SpotifyToVinyl, ensuring that a developer can hit the ground running with clear tasks and deliverables for each phase.
